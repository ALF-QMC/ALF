# Xinyue's model


Dear Xinyue, could you please type in  the exact action that you want to simulate. In particular I would need to understand how the field couples to the spin, and where  and how the Hubbard U comes into  code.  YOu can use latex in the md file  as  shown below. 
$$
  \hat{H} = \cdots

Hi

We can use this file to exchange notes. 

Todo. 

- Compute spin-spin correlations in space and time   $  \langle \hat{S}_{q}(\tau) \hat{S}_{-q}(0)  \rangle $. 
- Single particle spectral function  $  \langle \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_k(\tau) \hat{c}^{\dagger}_k(0) \rangle  $
- Optical conductivity.   Current-current correlations. 
- Random number generator.  Try to use the one in ALF.
