# Xinyue's model


Dear Xinyue, could you please type in  the exact action that you want to simulate. In particular I would need to understand how the field couples to the spin, and where  and how the Hubbard U comes into  code.  YOu can use latex in the md file  as  shown below. 
$$
  \hat{H} = \cdots
$$

We can use this file to exchange notes.
