F.P.T is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -- project number 414456783.   Z.L. is funded  W\"urzburg-Dresden Cluster of Excellence on Complexity and Topology in Quantum Matter ct.qmat (EXC 2147, project-id 390858490). 
JSEP  thanks the DFG for financial support under the project AS120/14-1, dedicated to the further development of the ALF library.
Part of the optimization of the code was carried out during  the  Porting and Tuning Workshop 2016 offered by the Forschungszentrum J\"ulich.
Calculations performed to extensively test this package were carried out both on  SuperMUC-NG at the  Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and on  JURECA  \cite{Jureca16} at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre.  We thank both institutions for the generous allocation of computing time.
